# AbdomeTeachingFile
This is a R file that classified teaching file cases in groups.
From a list of patient IDs and a brief description of cases in Portuguese, this script was able to group the abdominal cases into groups such as "Renal", "Intestinal", "Neoplasic".
It is far from perfection, but for our needs it worked.
